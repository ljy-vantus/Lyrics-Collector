SUMMER TIME
------------------------------

Summertime, time, time
child, the living's easy.
Fish are jumping out
And the cotton, load,
Cotton's high, lord so high

Your daddy's rich
And your ma is so good-looking, baby,
She's a-looking good now,
Hush, baby, baby, baby now,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't you cry, Don't you cry,

One of these morning,
You're going to rise, rise up singing,
You're gonna spread your wings, child
And take, take to the sky,
Lord, the sky.

But till that morning
Honey n-n-nothing's going to harm ya,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
Don't you cryÔºÅCry,

Summertime, time, time
child, the living's easy.
Fish are jumping out
And the cotton, load,
Cotton's high, lord so high

Your daddy's rich
And your ma is so good-looking, baby,

She's a-looking good now,
Hush, baby, baby, baby now,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't you cry, Don't you cry,

Hush, baby, baby, baby, baby now,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't you cry, Don't you cry,
