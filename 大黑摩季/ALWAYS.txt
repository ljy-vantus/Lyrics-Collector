ALWAYS
------------------------------

Girl you are to me
All that a woman should be,
And I dedicate my life to you, always
A love like yours in rare,
It must have been sent from up above
And I know you'll stay this way for, always

And we both know
That our love will grow
And forever it will be
You and me

Ooh! You're like the sun
Chasing all the rain away
When you come around
You bring brighter days
You're the perfect one for me
And you forever will be
And I will love you so far, always

Came with me my sweet,
Let's go make a family
And they will bring us joy for always
Oh boy I love you so
Can't find enough ways to let you know
But you can be sure I'm yours for, always

And we both know
That our love will grow
And forever it will be
You and me

Ooh! You're like the sun
Chasing all the rain away
When you come around
You bring brighter days
You're the perfect one for me
And you forever will be
And I will love you so far, always
