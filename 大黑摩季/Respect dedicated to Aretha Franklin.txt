Respect dedicated to Aretha Franklin
------------------------------

What you want, baby, I got it
What you need, do you know I got it
All I'm askin' is for a little respect
When you come home (Just a little bit)
Hey baby (Just a lillte bit)
When you get home (Just a little bit)
Mister (Just a little bit)

I ain't gonna do you wrong
While you're gone
Ain't gonna do you wrong
'Cause I don't wanna
All I'm asking' is for a little respect
When you come home (Just a little bit)
Baby (Just a little bit)
When you get home (Just a little bit)
Yeah (Just a little bit)

I'm about to give you all my money
And all I'm asking in return honey
Is to give me my profits
When you get home
(Just a, just a, just a, just a)
Yeah baby
(Just a, just a, just a, just a)
When you get home (Just a little bit)
Yeah (Just a little bit)

Ooh your kiss is sweeter than honey
And guess what, so is my money
All I want you to do for me
Is give it to me when you get home
Yeah baby, whip it to me (Respect)
When you get home (Just a little bit)
Now (Just a little bit)

R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Find out what it means to me
R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Take care of TCB
Oh a little respect
(Sook it to me)(Respect)
Oh a little respect
(Just a little bit, just a little bit)
I get tired (Just a little bit)
Keep on tryin' (Just a little bit)
You are runnin' out of fools
(Just a little bit)
And I ain't lyin' (Just a little bit)
Respect when you come home
Or your might walk in
And find out I'm gone...
