Bang！ Come along！ Move along！
get down, I'm your moon Hey hey hey hey
Ha～ What my life would be？
If I stand alone…shaking in the rain…
Dance！

If I stand all alone,
covered in sorrow…hey, uh yeah…
Will the rain hide my tears？
I'll dance alone…awake in the veil

It's been clicking in my head…
Lights are shining far ahead
I've been looking for you, girl
For all day long…nothing's gonna change this love
I know that I can be a fool
The sky painted like a jewel
For once in my life, I'll be dancing in the rain

Livin' in your dream
Kissin' in your dream
Singing in the gleam

Ha...You lit the moon,
hey yeah, oh yeah
Ha...Now light the room
Oh yeah, hey…
Let me take your hand


I was lost…but how？ I still need you, ha…
You opened up my heart, till I see no clouds, ha…

I've been thinking about the days…
That I tried in many ways
Love was just a simple phrase
For all day long…staring at the stars high above
I know that I can be a fool
The sky painted like a jewel
For once in my life I'll be dancing in the rain

Livin' in your dream
Kissin' in your dream
Singing in the gleam

Ha…
You lit the moon,
hey yeah, oh yeah
Ha...Now light the room
Oh yeah, hey…Let me take your hand

You lit the moon,
hey yeah, oh yeah
Ha…Now light the room
Oh yeah, hey…
Let me take your hand

Now when I walk alone,
I feel you oh…and
What if I stand alone and
I see you shaking in the rain…
DANCE！！
