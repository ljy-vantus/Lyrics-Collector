Fated
------------------------------

Someone said, A man has way of life
It's strong but fragile
Everything's fated Everything's fated

どこからか呼ぶsilent sound
無理に解(ほど)いてもround and round
この胸で熱く脈打つred blood
いつか世界の終わりに 思い出す風景があるとしたら･･･

beyond the time 手にした夢なのか?
and, close my eyes 手放したぬくもりの跡に残る涙か?

Everything's Fated Fated 生き様を
It's Fated Fated 見せてやれ
It's Fated Fated Fated
Everything's Fated Fated 咲き誇り
It's Fated Fated 散ってゆけ
It's Fated Fated It's Fated

oh hey guys! Whatcha gonna do?
oh hey guys! Whatcha gonna do?
oh hey guys! Whatcha gonna do?
oh hey guys! Whatcha gonna do?
oh hey guys! Whatcha gonna do?
oh hey guys! Whatcha gonna do?

Everything's Fated Fated 生き様を
It's Fated Fated 見せてやれ
It's Fated Fated Fated
Everything's Fated Fated 咲き誇り
It's Fated Fated 散ってゆけ
It's Fated Fated It's Fated

哀しみの向こうには輝きがあることを
乗り越えた者だけ知る
別れてはまた出会い 明日への戦いも
全部alright それが美学way of life

oh hey guys! Whatcha gonna do?
oh hey guys! Whatcha gonna do?
oh hey guys! Whatcha gonna do?

息づいているmother's soul
受け継いだのはfather's mind
その日まで生かされてる命
愛ゆえに傷ついて それでも愛を捨てて生きたくはない

in my mind 聞こえるあのメロディ
close my eyes 今は守るべき人のために歌うLove song

Everything's Fated Fated 生き様を
It's Fated Fated 見せてやれ
It's Fated Fated Fated
Everything's Fated Fated 咲き誇り
It's Fated Fated 散ってゆけ
It's Fated Fated It's Fated

哀しみの向こうには輝きがあることを
乗り越えた者だけ知る
別れてはまた出会い 明日への戦いも
全部alright それが美学way of life

Someone said, A man has way of life
Everything's fated Everything's fated

哀しみの向こうには輝きがあることを
乗り越えた者だけ知る
別れてはまた出会い 明日への戦いも
全部alright それが美学way of life

Everything's Fated Fated 生き様を
It's Fated Fated 見せてやれ
It's Fated Fated Fated
Everything's Fated Fated 咲き誇り
It's Fated Fated 散ってゆけ
It's Fated Fated It's Fated
